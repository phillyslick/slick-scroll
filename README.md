slick-scroll
============

JS (jQuery for now) plugin for one page navigation - smooth scrolling.

+ My Very Own Class for navigation scrolling.
+ Depends on JQuery for the time being.
+ Initialize with a parent containing some children containing some links
+ i.e. a ul with some <li>s with some <a href="#something">s
+ make sure you've got a <tag id="something"> somewhere on the page
